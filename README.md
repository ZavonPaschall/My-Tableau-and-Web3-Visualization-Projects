* **KPI Activity Tracker & Auto Tweet Integration:** A static dashboard that tracks daily progress of all $BERN burnt/rewards and $BONK rewarded by the specific address: 7MyTjmRygJoCuDBUtAuSugiYZFULD2SWaoUTmtjtRDzD. After calculating the numbers, it passes the JSON Webhook to Google Sheets, then the Google Apps Script receives and places the info within the sheet. If there is new information, our Twitter integration with Sheets will make a tweet if all parameters are met.
